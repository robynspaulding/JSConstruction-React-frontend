# Where To Next?
React.js Frontend


This front end is the user interface for a construction website that will display the company's profiles/About section, protfolio and Woodshop inventory and allow for the owner to update each section as needed from the front end, as well as for costumers to contact the company to request services, quotes or purchase items. 

# Technology used:
- <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-React-frontend">React.js frontend - This Repo!</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-API">Ruby on Rails backend </a>
- More to come ...

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-React-frontend.git
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-API">Jordan Spaulding Construction Website API </a> running on http://localhost:3000.

You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Future Plans

- Iâ€™m still working on is the contact form for costumers
- Styling to have a more polished and professional look.
