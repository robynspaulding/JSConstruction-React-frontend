# Where To Next?
React.js Frontend


Where To Next? is a travel planning app that allows a user to create a trip and add places they want to visit while they are on that trip. Within the trip show page -or rather where you can see the details of the trip and the places you want to go - there is a search bar that accesses a third-party API called <a href="https://serpapi.com/"> SerpApi </a> which scrapes Google results based on your search query and location input. 

# Technology used:
- <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-React-frontend">React.js frontend - This Repo!</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-API">Ruby on Rails backend </a>
More to come ...

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-React-frontend.git
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/JSConstruction-API">Jordan Spaulding Construction Website API </a> running on http://localhost:3000.

You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Future Plans

- Iâ€™m still working on is the contact form, and the admin login so that the owner can update, add and delete items 

- Styling to have a more polished and professional look.
